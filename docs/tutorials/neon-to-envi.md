# Tutorial: NEON → Corrected ENVI (BRDF + Topographic)

!!! note "Canonical learning path"
    This older tutorial is retained for stable links. Use [Correct NEON
    reflectance](../vignettes/neon-correction.md) for the canonical module
    vignette.

This tutorial walks through converting NEON hyperspectral HDF5 files into physically corrected ENVI reflectance cubes. The output is the foundational product used in all downstream harmonization workflows (e.g., Landsat-style reflectance).

---

## Overview

You will learn how to:

1. download NEON directional reflectance tiles
2. export them to ENVI format
3. apply topographic correction
4. apply BRDF correction
5. inspect corrected outputs and QA artifacts

This tutorial assumes you have installed SpectralBridge and have run through the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md).

---

## 1. Set up a working directory

```bash
BASE=output_neon_to_envi
mkdir -p "$BASE"
```

---

## 2. Run the pipeline for one flight line

Here we process a single NEON hyperspectral flight line at NIWO.

```bash
spectralbridge-pipeline \
  --base-folder "$BASE" \
  --site-code NIWO \
  --year-month 2023-08 \
  --product-code DP1.30006.001 \
  --flight-lines NEON_D13_NIWO_DP1_L020-1_20230815_directional_reflectance \
  --engine thread \
  --max-workers 2
```

The command will:

- fetch the necessary HDF5 files
- export directional reflectance to ENVI (`*_envi.img/.hdr`)
- apply topographic correction
- apply BRDF correction
- write corrected ENVI reflectance (`*_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img`)
- generate QA PNG, PDF, and JSON files

Re-running the command will skip completed stages.

---

## 3. What the corrected ENVI product contains

A corrected flight line directory contains files such as:

- `*_directional_reflectance_envi.img`
- `*_topocorrected_envi.img`
- `*_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img`
- `*_qa.png`
- `*_qa.pdf`
- `*_qa.json`

The key output is `*_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img`, which contains physically corrected reflectance values suitable for sensor harmonization or modeling.

---

## 4. Inspect the corrected ENVI cube

You can view the ENVI product using:

- ENVI/IDL
- QGIS (with raster bands exposed)
- Python libraries such as `rioxarray` or `spectral`

Example in Python:

```python
import rioxarray as rxr

cube = rxr.open_rasterio("path/to/..._brdfandtopo_corrected_envi.img")
cube
```

This loads the corrected reflectance cube into an `xarray.DataArray`.

---

## 5. Inspect QA outputs

Open the QA PNG:

```bash
open "$BASE/..._qa.png"
```

The QA panel includes:

- reflectance range checks
- brightness differences across correction stages
- mask summary statistics
- wavelength and band metadata
- BRDF / topographic coefficient summaries

The PDF version includes multi-page diagnostics and expanded panels.

## 6. Next steps

Proceed to:

- [NEON → Landsat reflectance](neon-to-landsat.md)
- [Pipeline stages](../pipeline/stages.md) for in-depth explanations
- [Working with Parquet](../usage/parquet.md) to extract and analyze pixel spectra
