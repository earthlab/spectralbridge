# Polygon spectral library pipeline

The polygon workflow augments the standard flightline processing by producing
per-polygon spectral libraries from the existing pixel-level Parquet products.
The pipeline is optional today and can be invoked programmatically without
changing the default `spectralbridge-pipeline` behaviour.

## Overview

The polygon pipeline performs three steps for each flightline:

1. **Polygon–pixel index** – rasterises a polygon layer against a chosen NEON
   product (BRDF/topography corrected ENVI by default) and records the pixels
   that intersect each polygon, including spatial metadata and polygon
   attributes, in ``*_polygon_pixel_index.parquet``.
2. **Polygon-only Parquets** – filters the existing per-product Parquet tables
   so that only pixels found in the index are retained.  Outputs follow the
   pattern ``*_envi_polygons.parquet``,
   ``*_brdfandtopo_corrected_envi_polygons.parquet`` and
   ``*_landsat_tm_envi_polygons.parquet`` (etc.). Each output row still
   represents one pixel, but it also carries the polygon identifier and the
   polygon attribute columns so species labels and field measurements travel
   with every extracted pixel.
3. **Merged polygon spectral library** – joins the polygon-only Parquets with
   the polygon index to produce a compact spectral library for all polygons in a
   flightline: ``*_polygons_merged_pixel_extraction.parquet``.

The helper functions live in :mod:`spectralbridge.polygons` and are available
for bespoke workflows while we evaluate the approach.

## Data requirements

* A processed flightline directory with the usual per-product Parquet tables.
* A polygon vector file readable by GeoPandas (e.g. GeoPackage, Shapefile,
  GeoJSON).  The repository ships with a sample data set at
  ``Datasets/niwot_aop_polygons_2023_12_8_23_analysis_ready_half_diam.gpkg``.

Polygons are reprojected automatically to match the reference raster used for
the index.  A ``polygon_id`` column is honoured if present; otherwise a unique
identifier is generated.

## Example usage

```python
from spectralbridge.paths import FlightlinePaths
from spectralbridge.polygons import run_polygon_pipeline_for_flightline

flight_paths = FlightlinePaths("/data/flightlines", "NEON_D12_NIWO_2021")
polygons_path = "Datasets/niwot_aop_polygons_2023_12_8_23_analysis_ready_half_diam.gpkg"

result = run_polygon_pipeline_for_flightline(
    flight_paths,
    polygons_path,
    products=[
        "envi",
        "brdfandtopo_corrected_envi",
        "landsat_tm_envi",
        "landsat_oli_envi",
        "micasense_envi",
    ],
)

print(result["polygon_index_path"])
print(result["polygon_merged_parquet"])
```

Each helper is also available individually for advanced scenarios:

* :func:`build_polygon_pixel_index` – create the polygon pixel lookup table.
* :func:`extract_polygon_parquets_for_flightline` – generate polygon-only
  Parquet tables for a subset of products.
* :func:`merge_polygon_parquets_for_flightline` – merge polygon Parquets into a
  single spectral library.

## Status and roadmap

The polygon pipeline is **opt-in** today and does not run as part of the
standard flightline orchestration.  The utilities introduced here allow data
teams to experiment with polygon spectral libraries ahead of tighter
integration in a future release.
