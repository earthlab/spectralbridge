# JSON Schemas

The pipeline emits several JSON files containing structured metadata and QA metrics. These files allow downstream tools to audit processing decisions and validate outputs.

This page summarizes the purpose and structure of each schema.

---

## 1. ENVI export metadata

Recorded in:

*_export_metadata.json

Contains:

- wavelength array  
- band names  
- reflectance scaling (NEON conventions)  
- mask types and bit fields  
- CRS and affine transform  

---

## 2. Topographic correction metadata

*_topo_metadata.json

Includes:

- slope and aspect statistics  
- solar geometry used  
- mask adjustments  
- correction parameters  

---

## 3. BRDF metadata

*_brdf_metadata.json

Includes:

- BRDF coefficients per wavelength  
- RMSE of BRDF fits  
- flags for unstable fits  
- view/sun geometry summaries  

The streamlined BRDF coefficient payload is also written as:

*_brdf_model.json

This model JSON contains:

- `iso`, `vol`, and `geo` coefficient tables  
- kernel names used during fitting/application  
- geometric kernel parameters such as `b_r`, `h_b`, and `solar_zn_type`  
- `ndvi_edges`, which stores the realized NDVI bin boundaries (`n_bins + 1`
  values) used to stratify the coefficient rows  

`ndvi_edges` is metadata for interpreting the BRDF model. It explains which
NDVI stratum each coefficient row belongs to; it is not a per-pixel NDVI
product.

## 4. Convolution metadata (sensor harmonization)

*_convolution_metadata.json

Contains:

- SRF files used  
- wavelength alignment checks  
- brightness correction coefficients  
- bandpass integration statistics  

---

## 5. QA metrics schema

The QA JSON file contains:

- reflectance summary statistics  
- mask percentages  
- wavelength metadata  
- BRDF/brightness coefficients  
- geometry metadata  

Exact fields are defined in the validation section.

## Using schemas in downstream workflows

These JSON files support:

- reproducibility  
- debugging  
- statistical evaluation of harmonization quality  
- provenance tracking for scientific analyses
